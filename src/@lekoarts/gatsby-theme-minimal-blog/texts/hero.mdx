I'm Gavin. I'm a tinker, maker, and software developer. At home I code, game, hang out, all the cool non robot things to do.
    Heavily involved with Jenkins open source, and will often submit PRs to random other projects.  I also play games, both board and video games and love to read.
    You can usually find me on various services as halkeye.
