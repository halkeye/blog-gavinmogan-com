A project I worked on with [Stephen Tiu](http://stephentiu.uchikoma.org/) for some of the conventions we volunteered at.
We created it as an attempt to be a self manage ticketing system that could be setup once, then reused from year to year.

Some features include:

*   Multiple Ticket options
*   History of past tickets
*   QR Code generation
