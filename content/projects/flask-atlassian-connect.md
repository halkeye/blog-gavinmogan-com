Little library to make it easier to write atlassian cloud integrations.
I personally used it to write a [bamboohr](https://github.com/saucelabs/it-jira-bamboohr) integration.
We used it a couple of times at saucelabs to write a couple other applications as well.
This is my first released python module.
