What ever happened to giving people phone numbers?  

I was walking back from pacific center, and I saw some girl giving a guy her phone number... but curisoity struck, I wanted to see if that was what it was... No, she was giving him her email/msn address?

How am I ever going to convince the world to use other things if they all keep failing to not use msn like that?
