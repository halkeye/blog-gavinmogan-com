Muhahahah. Been playing with Outlook 2003 as I now have a legal key from school (no more fighting with open office to read school crap).

Its soo cool to play with the crap, but I don't get enough emails to really have fun. I'm so tempted to disable the spam filtering software again or sign up for crap, just so i can get emails. And have outlook put up a notification that I have email and stuff.

Its sad no? But people seem to like to IM people instead of emailing. I have to start trying to get in contact with my distant family so I get letters again. Maybe it might even help improve my writing ability.
