Yea Yea, if this works, then MTLJPost 1.6 Is ready to go.  

1.7 will follow quite quickly.. but I want to make a clean realease of this before i move on.

<s>[Download Version 1.6](http://www.halkeye.net/files/?file=MTLJPost.1.6.tgz).</s>

This comes with MANY improvements, as the other one died most of the time.

Simple Install Instructions  

> .pl goes to mt/plugins/  

> .pm goes to mt/extlib/MT/Plugins/  

> .tmpl goes to mt/tmpl/mtljpost/  

> .cgi goes to mt/ (or whever you have your other cgi files)

Its kinda exciting.

The javascript on the login information page is NIIIICE.
