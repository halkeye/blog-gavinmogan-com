Yea Yea, if this works, then MTLJPost 1.6 Is ready to go.  

1.7 will follow quite quickly.. but I want to make a clean realease of this before i move on.

<s>[Download Version 1.6](https://files.halkeye.net/MTLJPost.1.6.tgz).</s>

This comes with MANY improvements, as the other one died most of the time.

Simple Install Instructions  

> .pl goes to mt/plugins/  

> .pm goes to mt/extlib/MT/Plugins/  

> .tmpl goes to mt/tmpl/mtljpost/  

> .cgi goes to mt/ (or whever you have your other cgi files)

Its kinda exciting.

The javascript on the login information page is NIIIICE.

**Update:** added [Instructions](https://web.archive.org/web/20061224073602/http://www.kodekoan.com:80/project/MTLJPost) and submitted to [mt-plugins.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20040413083748/http://mt-plugins.org:80/)

<s>**Update:** [Download Version 1.6.5](https://files.halkeye.net/MTLJPost.1.6.5.tgz).</s>
