Man, been working on trying to setup my webserver cleaner, more importantly get php setup better..

Attempted to do that yesterday, man that sucked, ended up trying to get mod_php, mod_perl and mod_python installed as DSOs, only to find out that none of them seemed to want to work right.

So any bad stuff on servers yesterday should probably just be quietly ignored :) going to have to spend some more time on this trying to figure it out. I think i just compiled PHP badly with conflicting mysql libraries or something...
