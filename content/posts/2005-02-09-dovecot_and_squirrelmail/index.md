Man, [dovecot](http://www.dovecot.org/) is more my favorite email imap server software.

I just installed squirrelmail from scratch, and man, its so fast. with my old server, i was using courier and squirrelmail, both debian packages, and man, it'd time out half the time, break others, etc etc etc.

The server isn't any more powerful than the one i had at home, but man, its nice. Except it looks like squirrelmail caches sometimes so some emails don't get moved right away.
