I was about to complain about it being a trial version... but man, it looks cool.. 

I've abandoned this site for so long its not even funny. I have been poking at it, but lots of behind the scenes things. I don't think I even have enough battery to really put a good update it.. 

Things I've been working on: 

  * http://www.kodekoan.com - Kode Koan (Mini company thingie) 
  * http://www.mythtv.org - mythtv - Getting quite close too.. almost ready to re subscribe to cable.. and get some hard drives to store dvds on (so i don't have to swap so much :D lazyness++). Just need to play with the hauppage IR blaster some more.
  * Oblivion++
  * Indexing all my dvds, books and such so i can keep track of things when i loan them out
  * Starting a new job at AIRG

Yea, with ecto I'm going to try to remember to update more. Maybe even get the lj syncing working again.
