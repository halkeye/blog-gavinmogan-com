# Pick up lines?

Ever had one of those days where someone said something, and like a week later you had a perfect response for it? Statement: I'm watching my figure. Now, at the time, what do you say? Well I finally figured out a corney response. Answer: And what a figure it is. I mean, I've probably heard it somewhere, I'm not that kind of original. But still.
