Done; in the 0.11 release - I've attached that version. Taken from the docs:  

 $lj->DefaultPicURL()  

 Returns the URL of the default picture used by the user.  

 Note that if the LiveJournal object was created with  

 either "pics" set to "0" or with "fast" set to "1" then  

 this function will always return an error.

 Example code:  

 print $lj->DefaultPicURL(),"\n";
