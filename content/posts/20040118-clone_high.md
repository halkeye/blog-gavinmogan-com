# Clone High

After watching _Clone High_ so many times, I've finally figured out who is the voice actress for Cleopatra. I can't belive I never knew.. Then suddently I reconized Kate (dunno actress's name, but from drew carry) voice... Its soo cool now :) And I just found out that Jeri Ryan was actually in _Who's the boss_, I since I was looking her up in [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/), I found out she's done all kinds of other interesting things. Even the voices for the Elite Forces computer game.
