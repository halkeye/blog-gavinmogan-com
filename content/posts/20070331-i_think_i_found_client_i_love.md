# I think I found a client I love.

Playing with ecto and blogjet today.

I have to say, I’m find blogjet so much better. I’m still not sure I want to *pay* for a client.

 

PS, C&C3 is much better than expected. The FMV are so nice, I kinda hope it becomes a trend again.

PPS, Livejournal has an [April Fools Post](http://news.livejournal.com/97749.html?mode=reply&style=mine) this year, albeit very early :)
