I've recently been preparing sites to move to [drupal 5](https://web.archive.org/web/20070831111543/http://drupal.org:80/) for the new awesome server I got. I mean I could set the thing up using php4 and make all the old sites work and such.

Anyways, during this process (and I'm having fun really playing with drupal 5 this time), I decided to setup the log parsing program, awstats for both [hiscifi](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913020413/http://www.hiscifi.com:80/) and [zannen](https://web.archive.org/web/20070911173203/http://www.zannen.ca:80/) (since those are the two major upgrades i gotta do first).. Its suprising to see who's linked to hiscifi.com, but even more surprising is the people (some I actually know) who use zannen.ca as a source.

On the new server I'm going to be organizing things a lot better. I've already setup a secondary dns server this time (although i'm going to probably switch it sometime when I can find a "buddy"), and I'm going to be setting up a stats vhost for people to check their own website stats. Its going to be pretty awesome once I get there.

I'm sure there will be some tech posts as I go.
