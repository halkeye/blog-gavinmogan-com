[“The Secret Loves of Geek Girls”](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hopelnicholson/the-secret-loves-of-geek-girls) so far is really good. I’m only on the first story though. Its going to be another hard one to read. Partially because its a book of short stories (i get distracted) and partially, like “Hyperbole and a half”, it puts me into a retrospective headspace where I get thinking about my flaws. The ones I can manage. The ones I can't. The ones I really want people to understand, and the ones people do.

Its going to be a long read I think. But so far its really awesome.
