Sweet, now anyone who has an account can use my server wherever they go.

I'm now using pop-before-smtp (and imap) so you can log into the imap server, then for the next.... i'm not sure how long,y ou can send email.. I think i'm going to use [lucas's](https://www.negaverse.org) c program, or possibly even write my own... Except i'd have to figure out alot.. so lucas's sounds better..

Next up... Replacing Apache-perl with regular apache, making my config more optimal and not eat up so much ram.. heck i might even look into using apache2.

And thats it for my server update.
