Okay, my Last 2-3 posts here looked like they had something to do with work.

Well in just under 2.5 weeks now, I will be back to being unemployeed.

I'm just in the process of getting my resume cleaned up (again) before actually setting it up as a web page on the site. I doubt too many potential employers will see this, especially since its been so long since I last updated things.
