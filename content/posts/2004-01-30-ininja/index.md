Been playing iNinja again between releases.. okay, since first release and second of MTLJPost...

I've almost gotten to the blue belt, and got the blue sword...  

Its actually kind of fun if you don't get stuck on a level...

I'm just one level away from blue belt... I really wish there was more to this game though, it would have made a much better christmas present then...

It seems to have a bit of a Samuri Jack feel, where everything is mechanical... Except for the main enamy ninja.. but they seem to be some sort of alien anyways..

And there is the Blue belt..  

Other than unlock doors, I havn't figured lut what they do yet..
