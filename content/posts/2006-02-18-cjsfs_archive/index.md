Finally got my script that downloads hiscifi (and jevon's future show if he ever gets a new one)
fixed up and running again.

Apparently [CJSF](https://www.cjsf.ca) updated thier archive pages (kplaylist) so my script had to be
totally hacked again. I hate scraping sites, its so.. finicy.. I tried this time to make the script a
little more lient, but its getting harder and harder each time to fix things.

I just wish we could get a ftp access or something so i don't waste thier time parsing the pages and such.

That or there was a (cheap) way for me to just record directy from the radio signal so I don't have
to worry about them breaking thier archives again (or shoutcast).Â
