I think, After exams are over (yes, I have ***another*** dose of midterms this week.. well one..), I might have to do a site update. The font sizes and other such items help to make my writing look very... unprofessional (so does the ... I use all the time).

I also have to do a small plug for [mrtg](http://www.mrtg.org/) 'cause its such an awsome tool, that produces [pretty graphs](http://www.halkeye.net/mrtg/), which are way more customizeable than I've used so far. That and [snmpd](http://www.net-snmp.org/) makes mrtg so easy to setup.

Speaking of snmp, I've learned quite a lot in the last week about it. And actually think one of [these sensor probes](http://www.javica.com/company/sensorprobe.html) would really be cool, except way to expensive. I'd love to be able to graph the temperature in this room. Actually, I probably could use a rss feed or something and a simple perl script, but it would not be in this room, more outside.

Most of which I've started to learn from [Kasia](http://www.unix-girl.com/blog)'s blog anyways.
