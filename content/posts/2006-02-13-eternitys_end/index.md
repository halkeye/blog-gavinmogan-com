Finished _The Eternity's End_ By Jeffrey A. Carver.. I wasn't impressed to start with, but man it ended up pretty good. Turns out its the last in a series of books, thats why it was so confusing at first. The guy is an awesome reader. I mean he's no Orsen Scott Card :D

Next up:  

* Northern Lights - Philip Pullman
