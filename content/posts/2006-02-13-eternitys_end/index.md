Finished [_The Eternity's End_ By Jeffrey A. Carver](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/364903).. I wasn't impressed to start with, but man it ended up pretty good. Turns out its the last in a series of books, thats why it was so confusing at first. The guy is an awesome reader. I mean he's no Orsen Scott Card :D

Next up:

* [Northern Lights - Philip Pullman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2176516.Northern_Lights)
