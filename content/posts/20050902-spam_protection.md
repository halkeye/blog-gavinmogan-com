# Spam Protection

I can't belive I had to install spam protection, so many spammers talking about hurricane katrina, or google.   
Just as a side note, MTLJPost is ready for the next release, I just havn't gotten around to packing it up, with this job, thinking about school, applying for other jobs, and my other projects, I have been quite busy. I hope to get it out there for this long weekend though.
