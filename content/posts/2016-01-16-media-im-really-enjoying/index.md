So I've had conversations with people recently about re-reading books and re-watching shows/movies. Now that its so easy to get new content through app stores, or e-book readers, the number of times I re-read has gone drastically down, but here are some of my lists of content I'll rewatch many times, or re-read, etc.


## Books





 
  * [Enders Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game)

 
  * [Old Man's War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51964.Old_Man_s_War) / [Fuzzy Nation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9647532-fuzzy-nation) / [The Android's Dream](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1126509.The_Android_s_Dream) / [Agent to the Stars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3188404-agent-to-the-stars)
