If the word 'rofl' appears in a bash.org quote, be concerned.
If it appears more than once, you can almost guarentee its a bad quote.


So many quotes had to be marked down this batch. They just released 42 quotes between about midnight (PST) last night and about 10am this morning.

Looks like some new mod is just approving everything. Some are good though.
