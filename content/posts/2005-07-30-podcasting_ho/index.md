I'm still trying to work out a new MT plugin to do podcasts cleanly for [HiSciFi](https://www.hiscifi.com/archives/2005/07/shows_are_up_1.html) (and smile like a donut).  

The current MTEnclosures works, but its sorta too general purpose to work cleanly, Jevon wants me to add itunes rss tags to the feed, and I can't do that with the current plugin.

Just trying to figure out how I want to do things. This CMSEnhancer plugin looks pretty cool, I could make this into a REALLY cool plugin if I did it that way, or a less interactive one and depends more on parsing the post otherwise.

We'll see won't we.

I still have to get thier new template finished and installed. Wonder which is more important. Probably the template as enclosures do work, just not well enough yet.
