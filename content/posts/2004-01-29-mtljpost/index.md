I have now finished version 1.0 of MTLJPost.

Yea, this was after [Kristian](https://web.archive.org/web/20031230042248/http://www.departmentk.com:80/) told me how he did it, I figured I could simplified things. And I did.

[Download here](https://files.halkeye.net/MTLJPost.tgz)

Instructions:  

Install LJ::Simple library, put .pl file in your Moveable Types MT Directory.  

Edit the .pl file and set:
