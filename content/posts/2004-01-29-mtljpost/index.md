I have now finished version 1.0 of MTLJPost.

Yea, this was after [Kristian](http://www.departmentk.com) told me how he did it, I figured I could simplified things. And I did.

Instructions:  

Install LJ::Simple library, put .pl file in your Moveable Types MT Directory.  

Edit the .pl file and set:

LJ_PASS - Password, obvious  

SITE_NAME - Your Sites Name
