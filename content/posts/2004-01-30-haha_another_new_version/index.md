1.0.2 Released

[Download New Version](https://files.halkeye.net/MTLJPost.tgz)

```
# 1.0.2 - January 30, 2004  

# - Added config file because I got tired of always having to change the file for release  

# # Format: blogid site username password  

# # 3 www.livejournal.com test test  

# # 4 www.deadjournal.com:90 test test  

# - Added handler to check for LJ::Simple and give a message without it  

```

At this rate I actually might want to find a perm link.  

I actually like this new version, the config file setup makes things alot easier to setup for multiple blog situations..

I just now want to see if I can't store extra information on a post, like what the postid and if it was posted and stuff, so any updates will be properly propegated to livejournal too.

That would actually be cool.

**Edit:** [Newer Version](https://www.kodekoan.com/project/MTLJPost)

## Comments

**[Kristian](#63 "2004-01-30 18:31:34"):** Some sort of BerkleyDB file thrown into the MT's DB directory? You can get the path from MT since you're running as a plugin...

**[Kristian](#64 "2004-01-30 20:27:03"):** Is it me or did oyu add that bit about MT::PluginData after I posted my comment?

**[Gavin](#65 "2004-01-30 21:21:18"):** After wards, I was testing 1.0.3... Editing posts now works.. Now you tell me that isn't better than your old method.
