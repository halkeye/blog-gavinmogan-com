After being out of playing games for so long, I've been dying to play Knights of the Old Republic after I've seen some of the commercials. Unfortunately i just learned that it won't be coming out for the PC until October, what a rip off.

I'm such a sucker when it comes to Star Wars, I mean i own a good chunk of the games (there are a few games related to the first movie that i don't own, but whatever). I have _Dark Forces_, which sucked, _Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight_, which rocked, and then _Jedi Knight 2_ (is that Dark Forces 3?), which was also an awsome game. And lastly, we can't forget Jedi Outcast, which was extremely fun, Unfortunately I don't think I've finished any of them, except maybe Jedi Knight 1. I suck when it comes to following through with games.

Even back when I was creating and playing on muds, They were almost all Star Wars based, I just loved the universe created there. Speaking of which, I've created a project for [Unknown Regions](http://www.kodekoan.com/project/ur) at my new project server database thingie.

Sadly, since its taken so long to come back to this entry, I've sorta forgotten what my point was... Guess nothing other than I'm a sucker for Star Wars games, since I love bioware games, i can't wait till it comes out. Man do i want it.. I'm even considering taking a stab at Star Wars galaxies, except I am so not into those games.
