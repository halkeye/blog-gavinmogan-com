Chapter In and Chapter Out, I just keep liking this book more and more..

Unlike mystery tv shows, this book puts up the information at the begging, but you really don't figure out whats going on until.. well I still havn't figured it out.

It connects with me soooo deeply.

I wish I had more to say about this.. But I so like this book.

I keep wanting to get to the end so I can finish. Just so I can find out the secret. The secret that got so many poeple killed. I'm starting to guess at things.. But each chapter ends up leading me in a slightly different direction. Such an awesome writer.

Such a powerful book.
