Ever had one of those days where someone said something, and like a week later you had a perfect response for it?

Statement: I'm watching my figure.

Now, at the time, what do you say?

Well I finally figured out a corney response.

Answer: And what a figure it is.

I mean, I've probably heard it somewhere, I'm not that kind of original. But still.
