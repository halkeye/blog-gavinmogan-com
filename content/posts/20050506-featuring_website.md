# Featuring website

I can never remember what version of website it is, doesn't actually matter, just that I now am using kodepost, which is my new web site software which is only for "blogging". Doesn't have all the other pages like halkpost attempted to, or anything like that, just is straight forward, has templates, comments, and trackbacks. Unfortuatly its not 100% done, the posting interface needs alot of work, some of the templates totally suck (might notice May 2005 on just about every entry page), few other things like that. But 'm very happy that people can comment now (not that I actually expect any, but now the ability isn't broken). To fix in the immediate future.  
* Archive links.  
* Trackback discovery when posting  
* <s>Comment / Trackback notification</s> whoo, its good to code again.
