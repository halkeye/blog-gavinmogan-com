[Scott Adams is an absolute genius](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2005/11/results_of_why_.html). I love his debating opt-outs for stupid people. My favorite being: 

> Omit key words. For example, if someone says that people can’t eat rocks, accuse the person of being stupid for suggesting that people can’t eat. Bonus points for arguing that some people CAN eat pebbles if they try hard enough.

And yes, I know i havn't posted for a while, just been busy with tons of other projects and a new job.
