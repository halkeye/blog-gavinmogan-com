Oh my.. [del.icio.us Bookmarks](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3615/) has to be one of the coolest new firefox (2.0) plugins.. Just like [flock](https://www.flock.com) did.

First it goes through, imports all your bookmarks to del.icio.us with some of the common tags for things you have. Everything you import is not shared by default, so you don't have to worry about private links.

Now I can go back to using the [comics](https://del.icio.us/halkeye/comics) tag I was using before.

I love this plugin so much.
