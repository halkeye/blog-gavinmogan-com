Review of [Multi Theft Auto](http://mtavc.com/) ![moocow](http://www.halkeye.net/files/images/2956_f5f06c8aba2da87601eb0384c0d65c0d.thumb.jpg)   
YEa, other than the website, i don't have much to say, it is REALLY fun... Just [Download](http://www.mtavc.com/) the client, install, and you are ready to go.. Its still very buggy, we get random crashes, lots of lag, but it would rock for a land party...
