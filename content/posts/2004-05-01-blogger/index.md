While I was walking around at lunch yesterday I saw someone with a blogger t-shirt.

I so wish at that moment I was walking WITH someone so I could point it out...

Ah well.

It was interesting never the less.

I wonder if thats the feeling people get when they see me in my Livejournal t-shirt?
