So mom like found me a copy of stargate season 6 cheaper than normal this week. ![stargate](http://www.halkeye.net/archives/xine_snapshot-4-thumb.png) I'm so excited about it.. Season 2 would have been better, but dude!! ITS STARGATE! That coupled with a new site design, and the multiple plugins, Its been a good week. And work is REALLY interesting, I'm learning so much, I'm teaching, and having so much fun there. This is like the PERFECTEST place for me to work. I showed dad the office last night, he's sooo excited not as much as I was though, I wore myself out again last night. :D
