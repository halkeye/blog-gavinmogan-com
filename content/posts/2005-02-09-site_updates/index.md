Apparently during the move to [ev1servers](http://ev1servers.net), alot of things broke. I've fixed user registration, eventually i need to add trackback and anonymous commenting, but due to poor original design on my part (mostly I just wasn't thinking i'd want them), its not going to happen any time soon. I've also added google ads, yes they are tacky, although I don't see them as that intrusive. I'm actually working on a few projects, including my new [comics system](http://comics.halkeye.net), which I would really like some feed back on by some people, I think i could setup a community building system that would work better than keenspace, and give something back cool to the community. I also have a few ideas in the work for cool projects (mostly sadly, atm, ripoff as other sites). I like doing the work, but i'm not sure if anyone will ever use them.
