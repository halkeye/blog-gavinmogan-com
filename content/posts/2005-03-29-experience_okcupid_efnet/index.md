Okay, noticed that there was an #okcupid IRC channel on efnet from one of the pages okcupid.com has on thier site.

I went in today looking for something else todo between the job hunting and project working that I've been doing lately. I was shocked to see they were nothing like the #livejournal (irc.chatjunkies.org) people, who talked about various different things.

From what I saw, the only thing in #okcupid was people posting links to various tests/quizes, and doing irc comment style compares of eachother (!compre [nick1] [nick2]). I made a comment to that effect, when they pretty much agreed with me (sarcasticly?), I responded with an "Awesome" and was going to wait things out to see if anything else was going to happen.

Next came up the moderation (+m) mode which means nobody but the higher ups can actually speak, and they sorta were taunty about it.. so as usual when I get around stupid people who like the whole +m power, I started to change my nick (the only thing you can do in an +m other than leave), and got kicked right afterwards. Came back, was like "oru", and got banned.

Now that pissed me off, mostly due to the general annoyed state I've been in lately, so I went about trying to see what the hell was going on. Went and logged into halkeye.net and tried to irc from there in. Got banned immediatly when I went "ban happy eh?".

18:44 &lt;galimon&gt; i said 2 lines, i don't rhink either were offensive  
18:45 &lt;noxic&gt; no one's offended  
18:45 &lt;noxic&gt; don't give yourself that much credit  
18:45 &lt;galimon&gt; i wasn't taking credit, just curious as to the ban happyness  
18:46 &lt;noxic&gt; you are unfunny and you changed your nick during +m  
18:46 &lt;noxic&gt; and because i do not know who you are, i don't feel like putting up with it  
18:46 &lt;noxic&gt; eof

Pretty much next started to think of any shells I had access to. darkwarriors and sfu.com are no irc so they were out.  

I don't want to get jordan's connection banned if he had any interest in poping in there. So just gave up on those avenues.

Did learn tonight that its much harder to use proxies than it used to be, I was hoping to cause a problem (bad me) and get more ip ranged banned, that would have just been cool. But found out that [TOR](https://www.torproject.org) was banned already from efnet and none of the other proxy lists i could get my hands on worked for irc anyways. So sorta just gave up.
