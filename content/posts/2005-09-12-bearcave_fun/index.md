I had alot of fun, but apparently i was tricked into this channel on efnet called #bearcave. I randomly chatted for a bit, and then got booted out by paranoid bots. Got a message from someone a few minutes later.


&lt;Hadal&gt; Sorry about that. I would have liked you to stay.  
&lt;halkeye&gt; heh  
&lt;halkeye&gt; no worries man  
&lt;Hadal&gt; Honestly. You seem fairly keen.  
&lt;halkeye&gt; heh, just bored  
&lt;halkeye&gt; this weird fella said i should go there  
&lt;halkeye&gt; so i did  
&lt;Hadal&gt; Not a prank, I hope?  
&lt;halkeye&gt; him, or me  
&lt;halkeye&gt; CrazyPale is pretty weird  
&lt;Hadal&gt; Did you know what the channel's purpose was before entering?  
&lt;halkeye&gt; not a clue  
&lt;Hadal&gt; Hmm.  
&lt;Hadal&gt; So you're not gay, then? :)  
&lt;halkeye&gt; me, no, sorry man  
&lt;halkeye&gt; but thats what i figured the channel was  
\* Hadal nods  
&lt;halkeye&gt; i'm not sure why the paranoid security is though  
&lt;Hadal&gt; A prank after all. I'm doubly sorry for the trouble.  
&lt;Hadal&gt; Oh, apparently it's a common joke to tell people to go to this channel, without an explanation.  
&lt;halkeye&gt; heh  
&lt;halkeye&gt; oh really? thats seem silly  
&lt;halkeye&gt; why goto places with good conversations?  
&lt;halkeye&gt; i mean a little quiet  
&lt;halkeye&gt; but decent enough  
&lt;Hadal&gt; You're supposed to freak out when you realise you're in a channel full of homos.  
&lt;halkeye&gt; oh no, was i? i'll get right on that  
&lt;Hadal&gt; That's the way it usually works, anyway.  
&lt;halkeye&gt; right after the witch burning  
&lt;halkeye&gt; and stoning  
&lt;Hadal&gt; If you hurry, you won't be late for the crucifixtion.  
&lt;halkeye&gt; sweet  
&lt;halkeye&gt; but don't want to forget the witches  
&lt;halkeye&gt; they might feel left out  
&lt;Hadal&gt; Yes; and their supple, pale flesh burns ever so nicely.  
&lt;halkeye&gt; and the old latex hats  
&lt;halkeye&gt; the smell, god the hell  
&lt;Hadal&gt; The resultant bonemeal is excellent for vigorous roses, however.
