LJ Was mentioned a few times today, but mostly because one of the accounts I was holding got a delete notification. I started to search for some historical posts:

*   <https://news.livejournal.com/58116.html> &lt;\-- LJ Singles (I remember signing * up for it, but not finding local people)
*   <https://news.livejournal.com/57395.html> &lt;\-- meetup.com starting (I used to run the local LJ meetups)
*   <https://news.livejournal.com/45260.html> &lt;\-- the great LJ BBQ. I was one of only 2 canadians there, they kept making me say "Canadian" things

Amused I am
