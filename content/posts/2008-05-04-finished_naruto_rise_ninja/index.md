I have to say, I'm totally surprised at this game. I was told before hand it was a pretty decent game, and it did keep me entertained for the week I rented it.

Now the game, as the anime, is very repetitive. I didn't find it too bad, but I ended up not finishing all the optional missions because I got tired of the racing missions.

The timed ones in general were not bad, but when you got 5-10 minute long races with traps that can easily delay you enough so you can't get to the next checkpoint it gets really annoying. The worst was the last one I did. I got to one gate from the end, then got stuck behind a trap. It took forever to get that far.

I also found the jutsu really awkward to do in battles too. You had to knock the other guy away far enough to wait for the bar to fill up fully. Luckly you could do smaller powered ones quicker. I ended up mostly just doing rapid regular combat combos.

But as I said, the game was overall enjoyable, and I did manage to finish the game.. at least I think I did, I got the credits, but then i was thrown back into town, so I'm not sure.

Either way, I'm glad I rented it, It doesn't have enough replayability to buy the game, but the one shot rental was kinda cool.
