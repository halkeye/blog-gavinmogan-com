I've never had more fun watching tv and anime and such..

On another note, I've setup Roaming Profiles finally at home. Since its just me, and there are no other computer working with it yet (trying to dual boot my linux laptop to mess with it). But some day... yeaaaaaaaa :)

Next steps for me are to try and work on the mail server, make it a little cleaner, so i don't have large ip access lists, lock it down with a user/password or something, and make the webserver alot more stable and less of a memory hog. i'll probably kill mod_perl todo this, as its really not that big of deal.

And thats my update for now.. I really have to get back into this.
