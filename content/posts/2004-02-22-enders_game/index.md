Its always so much fun to re-read enders game. So far each time I've done it I've always ended up being in a different mindset. May it be content with life (when I read it first, working at bosleys), or totally downish and depressed (last school year, very lonely and crap), or now, whatever I might be now.. I always find it interesting how jealous I am of ender and valentine. I just love this book, I can't wait to finish it another time. And I think on monday or tuesday Mom and I are going to the used book store to sell off alot of old (crappy) startrek books and magazines and stuff, so hopefully we can get Enders Shadow from there tooo.
