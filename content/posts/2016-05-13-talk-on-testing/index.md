One of my personal goals for this year is to start getting more comfortable sharing knowledge and talking infront of large crowds. As such, I volunteered to give a quick talk on testing, as its always been something I love doing, and ion the new job I thought it would be pretty appropriate.

This is my second [Code and Coffee](https://web.archive.org/web/20160504031434/http://www.meetup.com:80/Code-Coffee-Vancouver/?) talk ever, and I can see I'm still pretty nervious giving the talk, but I think other than a few technical glitches (which were thankfully edited out) it went really well.

I have so much fun doing them. I love the fact that people come up to you afterwards and walk to talk about topics.

Totally open for more ideas on what to talk about. So far I've done Vagrant and now Testing in general. I'd love more suggestions.
