Starting to work on this code again. Slowly working on migrating my entire site over to the new codebase. Part of the reason people probably havn't been noticing any updates that have happened on this server was the rss file was always linking to the wrong one, so i've finally fixed it so people are getting the correct information now. WHEEE. Yea. We've moved now. We'll I've moved now. Living with an awesome roommate. You can see us on cam at [/cam/](http://www.halkeye.net/cam/). Well its more the living room cam. It all started as just good fun, now its sorta stuck and we are used to it :D Yep.
