tl;dr - <http://yaoirpg.halkeye.net> is now live again

**Y**et **A**nother **O**nline **I**nteraction **R**ole **P**laying **G**ame was a project a group of us at BCIT put together. It was for some of internet studies course (Yea I'm that old / It hadn't been updated yet). Evan, the guy who named it, was also someone who spent a lot of time online and really enjoyed the idea of an acronym that people probably wouldn't get.

So YAOIRPG was born. We had to do lots of paperwork. Project Docs, Design Docs, ETC ETC. But we found everyone loved playing it. I actually got killed several times while I was trying to demo the game to the class. It was fully multiplayer. Not bad for a school project. We were not expected to finish it, just document the process. There was only one other team that manged to get something demoable (I think), and they had a simple app that transferred files.

Anyways, it came up in conversation recently, mostly because I still tell the story that the teacher was heard saying he loved yaoi and we in the know at the time were so amused by this.

I realized the code wasn't backed up, so I dug through some of my old hard drives, found the code and an old DB dump and this morning through a lot of trial and error (And actually minimal work) got it running in a recent version of php and mysql.

<http://yaoirpg.halkeye.net> now lives on heroku where it should forever run. Backed up to bitbucket 'cause I'm pretty ashamed of the code :D
