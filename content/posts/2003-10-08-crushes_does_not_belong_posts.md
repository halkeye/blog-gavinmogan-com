After reading Richard's ([Just a Gwai Lo](https://www.justagwailo.com)) post on [ Crushes](https://www.justagwailo.com/filter/2003/10/07/crushes), I started to think even more about my , um, extremly easy abilty to crush on people.. When I meet people for the first time (those exclude those i know online first), I usually get a huge crush on them.. It is about 99% of the time girls, but I have had a slight crush on a guy before.

But it did more or less, remind me how I feel about crushes.. When they do have a boyfriend, while the crush does seem to pass quicker, part of me is torn apart. But even worse than that, is when you belive you have a chance, then quickly notice signs to say something else... Not only that, but the crush tuns into more like an obsession, saying what if I did this, or if I said that instead... Constantly thinking about that person, because you belive it still has a chance to change...

It sucks.. I for one miss my days when I never thought about such things, I think it really changed last year when someone actually for once showed an interest in me. Even if she turned out not to really have much interest. :)

<s>Yea, thats my opinion on crushes.</s> Why do I keep trying to end my rants/posts/etc like that?
