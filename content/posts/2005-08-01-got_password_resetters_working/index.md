Its actually been a very productive long weekend for me, one of the few i guess.  

Spent most of it rebuilding software, reconfiguring applications, and creating new interfaces.  

So step by step:

* Installed MT on my server again  

* Started and nearly completed a new version of MTLJPost  

* Started on the [Hosting](http://hosting.kodekoan.com) interface. All the software is configured (with ftp and postfix being tweaked for various things today).  

* Finished the password resetter for [Hosting](http://hosting.kodekoan.com) at [/client/](http://hosting.kodekoan.com/client/)  

* Been playing with Class::DBI for the frontend for the mailbox and ftp login manager. Its actually coming along quite nicely if i wasn't getting html'ed out. I really gotta build some nice frontend libraries or standards templates, but next weekend probably.
