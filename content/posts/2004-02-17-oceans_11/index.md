galimon: i wish julia roberts was not in oceans 11  
Eela: why  
galimon: i hate her  
Eela: mona lisa's smile  
galimon: it was a minor role, but i hate her  
galimon: havn't seen it  
Weenog: oceans 11 was still pretty good despite her being in it  
Weenog: i dont really like her either My Thoughts Exactly. I don't know why I don't like Julia Roberts, maybe its her look, the roles she portrays, that face that always makes me think she is crying... Whatever it is, I try to avoid movies she's in unless I hear they are really good. I was quite shocked when I saw it was her in this one.   
One thing about being unemployed, you play more games, and watch more movies.
