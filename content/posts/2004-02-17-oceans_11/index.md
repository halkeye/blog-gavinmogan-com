My Thoughts Exactly.

I don't know why I don't like Julia Roberts, maybe its her look, the roles she portrays, that face that always makes me think she is crying... Whatever it is, I try to avoid movies she's in unless I hear they are really good.

I was quite shocked when I saw it was her in this one.

  

One thing about being unemployed, you play more games, and watch more movies.
