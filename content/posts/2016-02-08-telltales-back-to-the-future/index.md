The [Back to the Future Game](https://www.telltalegames.com/backtothefuture/) game created by Telltale came out in December 2010. As of yesterday (Feb 7th 2016) I finally got around to finishing the game. That's over 5 years for those who are doing math.

I'm not entirely sure why I picked it up again. I know I've been itching to get through the slew of games I've kickstarted over the last few years.

Back to the future was actually a kinda slow game to me. I got frustrated a couple of times by the canned responses when items I figured you could show people just say "I don't know what to do with that" type response. Some of the cutscenes felt slow and long too.

But overall, I really enjoyed it, especially the last couple chapters and the ending itself. If they ever release another adventure, especially with the newer engines, I'd probably pick it up. It was great fun. I loved the fact that Christopher Lloyd actually did all the voice acting for Doc. Micheal J Fox actually showed up a bit for the final chapter. The recurring characters were actually well thought out and enjoyable (or hated in an enjoyable way).

For various reasons over the years, I haven't been gaming all that much. I know some of it had to do with my monitor (which was also really old). Some had to do with the two bouts of Bells Paulsy, which caused minor eye damage. I suspect desk layout contributed as well. It might help that I'm back to doing a pure development job again.

Suffice to say, This year I've already finished two games, that's more than the last few years.

I can't see what ends up being next on the list.
