# My GoPro experiments

My mom got me a GoPro last year for my birthday, and as the weather has gotten a lot nicer, I've been using it for various projects. About a month ago now, I picked up this really cheap accessory pack off amazon. Its been a lot of fun to play with the various attachments and components. Yesterday on my bike ride to work, I decided it might be fun try out the chest harness. I put it on. Checked that it all worked. Everything seemed to work just fine. I didn't really think about how on a bike you are at least slightly bent over. The results? 45 min of looking at my handle bars. Its kinda fun to try to figure out where I am from the various peices you can see. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMiFnC1yzmQ] My next favourite experiement would be the suction cup mount. I stuck it to my outer window, and let it run for a little bit. Then timelapsed/sped up the 20 minute video down to 15 seconds.
