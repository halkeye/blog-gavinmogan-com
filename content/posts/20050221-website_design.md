# Website Design

Man do I love [Open Source Web Designs](http://oswd.org/). If i didn't use that site for at least the base, my sites would look as crappy as they did back in '95 :) Anyways new look, I'm quite happy with it, still needs some tweaking, but much better than the previous all white one.
