I find BCIT's ad a bit ironic.

Something like:

Go from:  

"Can I take your order?"  

to  

"Can you take my order?"

Its kinda funny, because, well in my personal experience, You come out of BCIT expecting to be able to find a good job, so you don't work at fast food joints, yet you really arn't that qualified, so you still end up going to fast food places as you are broke and cheap and stuff.

BAH TO BCIT

But that could just be me.

And I'm just bitter about that right now?
