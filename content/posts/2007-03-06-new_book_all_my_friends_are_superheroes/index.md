This weekend [Nigel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spatulus/) loaned me this short book called _All my friends are superheroes_. So far its been pretty awesome, but there's just one superhero description I have to share.

> ### The Dancer

> 
> The Dancer has direct communication with God, much like a personal phone line. The telephone she uses is her body and she dials by dancing. As such, her dancing is a very, very sensual thing.

> 
> In the past, whenever she went out dancing, she got hit on and hit on and hit on. She didn't like this at all. She hated it. It wasn't what she was trying to do. She just wanter to talk to God. She almost gave up dancing altogether. Then she got an idea.

> Now, just before she goes out dancing, the Dancer straddles a photocopier and makes copies of her vagina. When guys come up and hit on her, she justs hands them a copy.
