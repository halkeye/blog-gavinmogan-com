lets tell a story... ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2692/4202463656_140e4aa651_t.jpg) there once was a code monkey, always working hard, doing work for others ![](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4007/4202464026_2bc3ee4381_t.jpg) then one day, he turned completly evil, refused todo his work, went after people with plastic knives ![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2582/4201706163_1b67517208_t.jpg) so then he had to be taken care of in the most humane way possible.
