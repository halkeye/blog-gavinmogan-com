lets tell a story...
![](4202463656_140e4aa651.jpg)
there once was a code monkey,
always working hard, doing work for others
![](4202464026_2bc3ee4381.jpg)
then one day, he turned completly evil,
refused todo his work, went after people with plastic knives
![](4201706163_1b67517208.jpg)
so then he had to be taken care of in the most humane way possible.
