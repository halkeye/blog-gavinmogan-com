Wow, [Tin Man](https://www.scifi.com/tinman/) is... well it has zooey...
Well I have met all the characters, dorthy, tin man, guy without a brain, and I'm sure the heart guy too.

It's really .. out there.
Reminds me alot of the new Flash Gordon. I'm not really sure which is more..lamer..

It started off so bad, but its gotten a lot better, every time it starts to feel right and entertaining, something new and weird happening.

they keep talking about "The Oh.Zee.", as in the outer zone, but it sounds very WB like. We'll have to see what episode 2 is like.
