"It was legen-wait for it-dairy." - Barney But yes, honestly, how could a movie be any worse, the budget was sad, the acting...well... it was sad, they spent their money hiring a few big name actors.. i've seen better special effects on [slurrey](http://www.slurrey.com) videos. Specially the whole pirate ship music video thing, other than having T&A; in the video, it was so low budget.. Speaking of T&A;, it totally would have been a better movie if they had nudity and/or swearing. I know i've said usually it deters from movies, but honestly, it couldn't hurt this one. Really, all you can honestly say about it is "It was epic"
