I've been slowly trying out a couple random cat toys for the cat. So far mine has been mostly meh about them. These [cat springs](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000CMKHDG?) were highly recommended on amazon, so decided to check them out. The idea of cat playing with springs is very weird, but why not right?

Okay, I think that might have been a huge success.
