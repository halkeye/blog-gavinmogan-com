[Rockpoint P.D](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0310516) has to be one of the BEST canadian comedies, and one of the better cop shows on tv. I know people keep making fun of the mounties, like [Due South](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0108756). After seeing the ad on the tv again, i remembered how much i loved it, so i started to search the net for it (sadly, just so i could have some things to link).. Found out its actually filmed at or near [langley, B.C.](http://www.langleyadvance.com/011103/showtime/011103sh1.html), which makes it even cooler.. Everyone should check it out, its on comedy network.. at um..... 10:30 pm on <s>Wensday Nights</s>Thursday Nights on 57 (Comedy Network). (sorry, I mis-read the channel listing guide thingie) I have to rememeber to capitalize 'I' more, since i'm not using [ w.blogger](http://www.wbloggar.com/index.php?itemid=155) in linux, which i can easily run through spellchecker and fix that stupid capitlization.
