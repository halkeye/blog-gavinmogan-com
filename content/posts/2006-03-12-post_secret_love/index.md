Subject: A wonderful Birthday Gift

Dear Frank,

For my birthday, my long-time friends presented me with the Postsecret book. My friend had written a message in the front of the book telling me her secret was on page 278. I flipped through the book thinking it was a secret she related to and was surprised to find that page 278 was created by her. She had pasted in photos of us and written the words " this is the making of a lasting friendship" I was moved to tears. This was the most heartfelt, wonderful birthday gift I have ever received.
