I can't imagine me ever needing this again, but it does highlight bash's ability to strip extensions.

To convert avis to mkv's and update language from unknown to english:

```bash
for i in *.avi; do
  mkvmerge -o "${i%.avi}.mkv" "$i" \
  && mkvpropedit "${i%.avi}.mkv" --edit track:a1 \
  --set language=rus --edit track:a2 --set language=eng;
done
```
