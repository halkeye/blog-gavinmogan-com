# Site Update

Finished my [computers](http://www.halkeye.net/computers/) page about 30 minutes ago, been tweaking things, trimming the sidebar a bit. I'm pretty happy about the way the site has been turning out so far, except for the guestbook (i havn't gotten to it yet) everything is totally table free. I'm so contemplating removing the cam links, i never have it up publicly anymore anyways, not that i ever have people wanting to watch me sit here doing nearly nothing :) now if i had breasts :P
