I have now finished version 1.0 of MTLJTag.

I decided to call it MTLJTag instead of MTLJUSER because I'm supporting the &lt;lj comm&gt; too.

So, for version 1.0:

```
<lj user=halkeye>
<lj user="halkeye">
<lj comm=halkeye>
<lj comm="halkeye">
```

Future (1.1):

lj syn

comment support (only works for entries right now, I need to track that down.)  

lj-cut (Maybe, but it can sorta be done.)  

Preview Entry Support (Probably not useful)

Next Up: A serious site design... Trying to layout something now.. I wish I was way more artisticly creative.

**[richard](#8 "2004-01-19 13:56:43"):** Heh... I just used an MT Macro to do nick substition. I did this since I migrated 2 years of entries over and didn't feel up to replacing all the LJ user= tags. I also added LJ username replacement for people I tend to write about now... Works out okay.

**[Gavin](#9 "2004-01-19 14:00:43"):** Way to ruin my fun :D

But in all honesty, I didn't even .. well remember about macros until early this morning.

But this works, and I intend to impove it...
