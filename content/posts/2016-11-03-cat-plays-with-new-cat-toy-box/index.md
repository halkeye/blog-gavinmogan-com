I never know how to start these :)

I'm off on vacation this week so I kinda decided to do a bunch of chores. Among those, I ended up going online and buying a bunch of bulbs, garbage bags, etc. Things I needed but wasn't in a super rush for. During this little shopping spree I ended up getting the cat something new. A [little self groomer](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00D3NI2PG) you attach to the wall. So far she's shown no interest, but since it has catnip in it, we'll give it a bit of time and see how it turns out.

The best part is that it comes in a little box that you are supposed to cut a hole into and put a few treats in to make a quick cat toy. I decided why not....

I had to make the hole a tiny bit bigger before I took this video, she wasn't having any luck whats so ever. She's a super smart little one, but when it comes to food, completely dumb :D

She managed to get the handful of treats out in the end, but I thought it was quite awesome.

So next up I put one of her [springs](/2016/01/06/cat-2/) (which she absolutely still loves) in the box.

That was less successful, so i eventually took it out for her. I just loved the meow at the end.
