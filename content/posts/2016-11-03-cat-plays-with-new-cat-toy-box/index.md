I never know how to start these :) I'm off on vacation this week so I kinda decided to do a bunch of chores. Among those, I ended up going online and buying a bunch of bulbs, garbage bags, etc. Things I needed but wasn't in a super rush for. During this little shopping spree I ended up getting the cat something new. A [little self groomer](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00D3NI2PG) you attach to the wall. So far she's shown no interest, but since it has catnip in it, we'll give it a bit of time and see how it turns out. The best part is that it comes in a little box that you are supposed to cut a hole into and put a few treats in to make a quick cat toy. I decided why not.... [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA8QBOpeoe8&w;=560&h;=315] I had to make the hole a tiny bit bigger before I took this video, she wasn't having any luck whats so ever. She's a super smart little one, but when it comes to food, completely dumb :D She managed to get the handful of treats out in the end, but I thought it was quite awesome. So next up I put one of her [springs ](https://www.halkeye.net/2016/01/06/cat-2/)(which she absolutely still loves) in the box.
