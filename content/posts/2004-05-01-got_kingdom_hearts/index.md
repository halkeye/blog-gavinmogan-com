15:47 < halkeye> hahah  
15:48 < halkeye> it only took me like 10 tries, but i finally beat riku in the race I so miss this game, I can't belive I restarted it so many times just to beat riku. I mean, I know that cutscene by heart now. Sora: If I win..ummmmmm. I'm captain.... And if you win  
Riku: I get to share a paupo with Kairi. Agreed?  
Sora: Wha? um...   
Actually not quite by heart, but i think thats it.  
And I finally beat him!!! score now of 2-1, from the previous battles!!!
