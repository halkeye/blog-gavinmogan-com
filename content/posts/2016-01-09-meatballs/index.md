So this year my mom decided I should have a KitchenAid Mix Master for christmas. So far I'm loving it. Last weekend I totally experimented by making my first ever batch of meatballs. So [Nigel](https://www.forgreatjustice.ca/)Â and I go off to the store to figure out what we can find. We end up wanting a mixture of meats, so we go with ground turkey and ground sirloin beef.
