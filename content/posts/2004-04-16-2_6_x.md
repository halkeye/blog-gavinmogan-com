Man this kernel is so much of an improvement over 2.4.x  

I mean, so many things that wern't supported last time I tried running linux on my desktop.

But for some reason, I'm back to having really crappy luck with kernels.  

Luckly I am using grub this time, otherwise it would really be painful.  

But I wish I didn't have to reboot to test them, since its kills what little productivity I have.

Lets just say, I'm bored enough I'm spending time fighting with it again.. and I might have a webcam again *GASP*. And maybe my graphics card drivers will work again at some point... stupid radeon.
