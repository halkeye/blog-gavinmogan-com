HAHA, this site is now RSS validated again.  
I didn't know what format I actually had, something I used from the old MT installation, but now its working again.

![\[Valid RSS\]](http://halkeye.net/img/valid-rss.png) I think all that is left is some validation in the xmlrpc interface, and then I'll start a cleaner version... KodePost or something. It'll go along nicely with my awesome [comic system](http://www.kodekomics.com) ([KodeKomic](http://www.kodekomics.com))
