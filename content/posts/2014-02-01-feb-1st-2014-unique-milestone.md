This will be one of my rare non tech posts on this blog (I think).

As of today, Feb 1st, 2014, It has been now 10 years since my last relationship ended with the infamous words "You can still date me if you want”.

I’ve brought it up with friends, mostly because it’s a weird kind of rare milestone. Most people then ask how I feel about it. It’s taken a while to figure out what to say. I only recently realized it was almost 10 years (sometime in December maybe). I was talking to a friend about school and came across some old albums and realized when things last ended. I feel like being single has not really been a big deal in my life.

Now some people have gone along the lines “have you tried dating?” or “Are you ready now?”. I think that just highlights people don’t really understand. I’ve never avoided it. I even tried online dating several times. Online dating really isn’t for (someone like) me. It puts a lot of pressure on the first encounter. I’m well aware that many meet people from online dating sites and go on to stay friends, but I don’t think that’s the norm. I know when I tried I always tried to made it clear that I was happy enough even just to make new friends but I’m also aware of how many horrible people that frequent on those sites. After meeting and/or chatting with people, I realized it's not the venue for me. I like getting to know people instead of instantly the comfortable way. 

So how do I feel about being single for so long? Overall I don’t think I regret it. Sure there are times when that’s not true, but they pass pretty quickly. It’s usually the moments when you realize you are the only person in a room that hasn’t paired up with someone. I would say none of the people I hang out with regularly has ever held that against me, but it does come up from time to time.

So is my status ever going to change? Who knows. I’m really happy where the path of life has taken me so far. I have some amazing friends. Met some amazing people. I love my job. I’m going to continue to go out, do things, meet new people if I can, and who knows, one day I might find that someone special, but I would never want to force it. It’s not who I am.

(Lets hope this comes across as positive as I wanted)
