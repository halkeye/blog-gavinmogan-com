This being sweeps week, and me being sick for now.. 6 days, I've had the chance to watch ALOT of tv shows. It was really interesting to compare the pre-air to the one aired this week of both reaper and bionic woman. I knew reaper was replacing a cast member, and you could easily tell all they did was replace the scenes with the one girl in them (she wasn't in any of the expensive ones anyways). Now bionic woman, they replaced a good chunk of cast, characters, and even minor plot points. Even with all the changes, it didn't seem all that much better, although the flow of the story didn't seem.. chunky like before, now really smooth flow between things.

Now, I did watch a couple season openers too, CSI, How I Met Your Mother, Simpsons, House, random other ones from dvds (Red Dwarf, Beast Wars), and I have to say, none of them even could compare to the season opener to Stargate Atlantis. Man that was a good one, It makes it worth while having to wait the 6(?) months for the cliffhanger to end, well... endish.

Go Atlantis! I already couldn't wait to see this years season after [Joseph Mallozzi](http://josephmallozzi.blogspot.com/)'s QA session at [Anime Evolution](http://animeevolution.com/) this year, and I'll defiantly make the effort to keep up to date and not try to watch them in batches like I have other years.


Oh, before I forget, Heroes was pretty awesome too, but I think Atlantis had a better season opener.
