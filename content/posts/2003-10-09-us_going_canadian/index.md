Yea, so I can't exactly find any online proof, But I saw a commercial today...

The United States seems to be getting a new 20 dollar bill. Its now colored... Just like canadian bills, I mean not nearly as much, but it stands out against the other bills now.

First thing that came to mind had to be "THE US HAS GONE CANADIAN".

  

Okay, so I'm quite lame.. but I though that was funny.
