[23:26] GreenMarshinz&gt; is c source code the same code structure in linux? header files and include etc.  
[23:27] halkeye&gt; GreenMarshinz, nope, C doesn't exist in linux, its a windows only thing  
[23:27] GreenMarshinz&gt; what about c++?  
[23:27] halkeye&gt; GreenMarshinz: linux only has assembly, and even then, you have to code with 1s and 0s  
[23:28] Christian&gt; halkeye ;|  
[23:28] GreenMarshinz&gt; huh? why is the gcc make and c++ compliers for linux?  
[23:28] GreenMarshinz&gt; there sorry.  
[23:29] halkeye&gt; GreenMarshinz: people like to pretend that there is, btu really, they don't do anything  
[23:30] GreenMarshinz&gt; so i have to write a program in 1's and 0's?  
[23:30] halkeye&gt; oh yea, and if you do it in the wrong order, your computer will self destruct  
[23:31] GreenMarshinz&gt; fuck it, i will write my programs in windows.  
[23:31] halkeye&gt; ...  
[23:31] GreenMarshinz&gt; cheers though.  
[23:31] GreenMarshinz&gt; later.

[23:32] Christian&gt; GreenMarshinz "man vi"  
[23:32] * halkeye really needs to come with a disclaimer  
[23:32] Christian&gt; yesssss  
[23:33] halkeye&gt; warning, listening to the halkeye can be hazardish to ones mental health
