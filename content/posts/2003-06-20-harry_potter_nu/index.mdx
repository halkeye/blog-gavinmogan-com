This has to be one of the saddest days in long time for news

The top story of the day.. no.. not war... no.. not sars...
Nope.. Its that harry potter and the order of the phoenix is due out in under 2 hours...

I still donno why this is so funny, I mean, I liked reading the books, they were well written, I think I liked the [Ender's games](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812550706/qid=1056171861/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/104-4963626-3159946) series a lot more... Well i've only read the first book, but still.

This whole phenomena is just... NUTS...

Weeeird, I can't wait till it fades away like after the last book, all though I think it'll take alot longer...
