I can't belive what we heard last night.

We go to get our tickets... Its only like 10.95.

Thats right!

Apparently the prices came down yesterday (well friday).

So instead of them being in the 13 dollar range. Its moved to the affordable 10/11 at night, and 8/9 during the day. And this is at silver city.

We were talking about it, and my theory is that people's easy ability to download movies, like using bittorrent and such now, had to force the movie theaters to become competitive again, and not price gouge.

Either way, its a good thing for movie goers.
