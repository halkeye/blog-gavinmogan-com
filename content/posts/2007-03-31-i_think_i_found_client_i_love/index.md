Playing with ecto and blogjet today.




I have to say, I’m find blogjet so much better. I’m still not sure I want to *pay* for a client.




 




PS, C&C3 is much better than expected. The FMV are so nice, I kinda hope it becomes a trend again.




PPS, Livejournal has an [April Fools Post](https://news.livejournal.com/97749.html?mode=reply&style=mine) this year, albeit very early :)
