[CNN.com - Qapla'! Hospital seeks Klingon speaker - May. 10, 2003](http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/West/05/10/offbeat.klingon.interpreter/) I know its a fairly old article, its been passed around online for a while now. But I just saw it posted again, and It reminded me more and more how much startrek had an inpact on society. Yea, unfortuatly, I got distracted before finishing this post.. I thought it was cool, and I should share.
