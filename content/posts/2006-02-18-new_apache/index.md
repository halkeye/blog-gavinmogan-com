Okay, Yesterday I finally got php and apache to play nice again and upgraded both installations.

Last time I attempted this I found there was alot of problems. Pages not working, perl + php not playing nice, etc.

I've tried out a bunch of the problematic pages this time, and everything seems to be working fine now.

Someone let me know if anything goes wrong.Â
