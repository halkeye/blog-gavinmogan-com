<s>R.I.P [OKRUT](https://www.okrut.com).</s>

[Lives long afterall](https://web.archive.org/web/20051211224953/http://www.orkut.com/GLogin.aspx?done=http://www.orkut.com/Default.aspx). I had a typo in the url :( silly google, apparently its a very common mistake.

as far as i can tell, its gone, and has been for a while.

Now all thats left is [myspace](https://www.myspace.com/halkeye), [friendster](https://web.archive.org/web/20240302044200/https://friendster.com/) and that MSN one.

Though friendster got a complete overhall it seems.

Actually friendster looks REALLY good.
