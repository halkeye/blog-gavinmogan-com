Whoa, amazon.com now seems to have prority information on thier [wishlist.](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/1B5Y9DCHJ489H/107-8946767-3520531)  

I'm going to have to go through and clean it up and set priorities sometimes.

  

But for now, back to the most fun project I've had in a while. (YES BAD ENGLISH RULES!)
