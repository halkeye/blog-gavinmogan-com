Someone explain these to me. I mean I understand not wanting to give your credit card to xbox. I sure didn't. There are so many stories of bad things with people being unable to un-associate cc#s and accounts, people racking up bills, etc. Plus if your account gets hacked, they get access to your CC.  
  
So I went out and bought the pre-paid cards. They are much easier to use, and I think safer. Except they are totally one time use, and after that.. they are done, you just toss them out. And they come in huge plastic cases too. I think this has to be like the biggest waste of packing i've had all year.  
  
Sad.  
  
Least now I can download games from live.
