So I've been working on and off now for a bit trying to upgrade [HiSciFi.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913020413/http://www.hiscifi.com:80/). Work to be able to re-enable comments and the like. Also been setting up stats tracking for my own interest (mostly to see where traffic is coming from and how much that site is using).

**do androids drea of electric sheep?**

I'm going to have to say thats the best search query yet... I mean [mike](https://web.archive.org/web/20070602004839/http://www.slurrey.com:80/) has some really.. disturbing one, but I think this is a pretty random one.
