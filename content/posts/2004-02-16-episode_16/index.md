Holy Shit [Fullmetal Alchemist](http://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,1265,mybywf,fullmetal_alche.html) has become interesting again. I'm just loving the characters and plot twists and such. Specially now that they finally got the villians introduced. It wasn't a slow start, but its finally gotten to a point where they need to be introduced..  
WHOA   
and to quote McDonalds and the [Jordan](http://j0rd.ath.cx)... **I'm loving it**
