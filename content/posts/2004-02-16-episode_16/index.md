Holy Shit [Fullmetal Alchemist](https://www.animenfo.com/animetitle,1265,mybywf,fullmetal_alche.html) has become interesting again.

I'm just loving the characters and plot twists and such.

Specially now that they finally got the villians introduced.

It wasn't a slow start, but its finally gotten to a point where they need to be introduced..  

WHOA

  

and to quote McDonalds and the [Jordan](https://j0rd.ath.cx)... **I'm loving it**
