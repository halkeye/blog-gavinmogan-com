Holy Shit [Fullmetal Alchemist](https://web.archive.org/web/20031012010513/http://www.animenfo.com:80/animetitle,1265,mybywf,fullmetal_alche.html) has become interesting again.

I'm just loving the characters and plot twists and such.

Specially now that they finally got the villians introduced.

It wasn't a slow start, but its finally gotten to a point where they need to be introduced..  

WHOA
