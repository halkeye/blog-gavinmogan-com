If you are like me, and just like going to common sites quickly.

For me, its simply Control + L (goes to location bar) then "perldoc" which gets me to [https://www.perldoc.com](https://perldoc.perl.org/) which I also end up using many times during the day, as I need to look up specific behavior of functions, like grep :)
