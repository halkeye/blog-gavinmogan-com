Ever since playing with alot of javascript and ajax for some of the new job stuff, I have been itching to rebuild [yaoirpg](https://yaoirpg.halkeye.net/), I'm sure its plenty full of holes and bugs, and you have to keep manually resetting everything..




I doubt it'll ever be battle mines, or legend of the green dragon, but it'll be fun to play with more AJAX and such.
