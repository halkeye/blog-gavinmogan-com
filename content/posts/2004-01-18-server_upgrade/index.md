Way to tired to really post about this... Server has been upgraded.. I had that machine to spare, but the graphics card is dead-ish, so i couldn't use it for anything else. So now the webserver/devserver/etc is now: os[Linux 2.6.1 - Debian testing/unstable] up[ 3 hours, 01 minutes] cpu[Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 1300MHz, 1296.069 MHz (2547.71 bogomips)] mem[ 240.65/249.40 MB (96.5%)] video[nVidia Corporation NV20 [GeForce3] (rev 163). at 1280x996 (8 bits)] I gotta kill the memory usage. And defanatly free up some hd space.. and probably setup some proper partitions (can I do that without partition magic and taking the server down? I doubt it). Yea. Now to upgrade the firewall machine.. Although i think i can just put some memory in and have a useful machine to spare.
