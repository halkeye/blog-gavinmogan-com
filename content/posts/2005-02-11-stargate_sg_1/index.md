Have been finishing off watching my Stargate SG-1 Season 7 dvds. I can't figure out why they replaced [Dr Wei](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0824763/) with a [new actress](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0383533/). I actually think the first one was a better fit for the role. And according to Jessica Steen (first actress)'s website, she didn't know why her character was re-casted.

How can you go wrong with the pilot from [the captain power tv show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092329/)?

I mean, I used to watch that show as a kid, before they were not allowed to have anything flashing on the tv, it rocked. I always wanted one of those toys.

I miss that show. I checked, amazon only has the vhs, no dvds.
