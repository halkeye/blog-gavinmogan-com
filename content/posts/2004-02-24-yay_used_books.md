Was also looking for dune and underworld, but she didn't have either at the time.

I can't belive we got $65 in credit for bringing in all those old (crappy) star trek books

Clerk: "Getting rid of all your startrek books eh?"  

Me: "yea.. didn't really like them"  

Me: "Not really my style"  

Me: "I can't stand books where you can totally predict the end" (weird that i reread books then eh.. maybne thats not totally it)  

Mom & Clerk: *chuckles*
