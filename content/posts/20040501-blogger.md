# Blogger

While I was walking around at lunch yesterday I saw someone with a blogger t-shirt. I so wish at that moment I was walking WITH someone so I could point it out... Ah well. It was interesting never the less. I wonder if thats the feeling people get when they see me in my Livejournal t-shirt?
