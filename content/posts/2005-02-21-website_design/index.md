Man do I love [Open Source Web Designs](https://web.archive.org/web/20050221010539/http://www.oswd.org:80/). If i didn't use that site for at least the base, my sites would look as crappy as they did back in '95 :)

Anyways new look, I'm quite happy with it, still needs some tweaking, but much better than the previous all white one.
