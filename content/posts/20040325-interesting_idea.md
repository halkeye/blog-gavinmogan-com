# An interesting idea...

[18:01] halkeye> you think a web based icq or aim program like squirrelmail is would be useful at all?  
[18:01] halkeye> like the non-java kind? I'd really like to mess with perl some more anyways, havn't done a real project in it in a while.  
And I hate java apps so much.
