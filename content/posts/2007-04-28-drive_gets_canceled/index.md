Its my new favorite show.. its hard to find a drama, specially a fox drama that i'll watch once, let alone multiple times but i've watch drive eps I have many times now.. MANY!!!  
Only to find out on the way home tonight that it has been canceled..




Seriously.. WTF..




I hope another network picks it up. I also hope that Direct to dvd becomes a more viable solution as this tv network thing really sucks.




Least stargate got a good run eh?
