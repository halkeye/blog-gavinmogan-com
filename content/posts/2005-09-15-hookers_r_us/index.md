Such a lovely neighbourhood I live in.  

How long has it been since i started to notice this stuff?

Tonight there was at least 1, probably 2 hookers out near the gas station, plus on the way home, in a dark corner near my building, two, probably hookers, were doing some sort of drug, i'd suspect coke or something as i didn't notice the usual potsmell from that location. They had alot of perfume, were obviously sorta out of it, specially by the tone of voice one used to ask me for the time, and the "thanks love" and such, all tends to make me think hookers again.

On the way in, one living here, probably not a hooker, but had skimpy but not sexy underwear sticking out the back of her low cut pants. shirt open showing as much cleavage as possible, and not to sound more stuck up, pretty dumb.. Couldn't figure out she had the wrong key for the front door (was using an apt key for the building door).

I donno, just seems like an overly dirty neighbourhood tonight, maybe i was just more alert, or too tired to block things from the subconcious.
