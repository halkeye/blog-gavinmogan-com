Note, I've recently found [WP Cli](https://wp-cli.org/) which makes all of this moot because i can now just do "wp plugin upgrade --all" or "wp plugin install blah"

Original post:

I decided a while ago to put pull all the plugin source codes for this wordpress install directly from subversion. This makes it easier when files need manual patching or more likely, a file gets deleted.

* https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/ is the svn root for all the wordpress plugins.
* https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/ is the svn root for all the themes

So I created this little helper script that I can use to do a mass update when I get too out of date.
