Sin Episode 1 was so awesome. I'm pretty sure i'm one of the very few people who's played the original.

I'm surprised that the game works so well in episode format.. Its weird, being only a couple hours long per episode, but its highly action packed, etc..

got so many pictures up in the [New Gallery](https://www.halkeye.net/node/193).
