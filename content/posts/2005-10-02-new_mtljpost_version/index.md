[ New Version of MTLJPost 1.9.2](https://kodekoan.com/projects/mtplugins/MTLJPost/1.9.2/)

Apparently there is confusion all over, so here's an email from the mailing list:

  

Okay, i thought i got all references to the extra files in the docs, but   

i didn't, and its a little late for me to try and rewrite the docs tonight.

Installation is just:  

plugins/MTLJPost/MTLJPost.pl

Everything else is linked from the main interface using the new 3.x   

plugin interface.

If you goto a specific blog, you can set that one up.

I removed all the extra files to make installation simpler, little did i   

know everything was opposite ;)

PS, my archiving script broke, so there was a bad version of the files   

up there up until about 5 minutes ago, so i suggest everyone redownload.

I just tried to download your script and it's only one file. I just wanted to make sure that's the way it's suppose to since you said something about files?

Thanks!

**[Laney](#4 "2005-11-16 18:51:21"):** Hi! I had LJ::Simple installed on my server but I get this message when I'm in the MT Plugins menu. I put the file in plugins/MTLJPost but I had to change the file to .pl file because it didn't unzip as one.

syntax error at /home/damaged/public_html/plugins/MTLJPost/MTLJPost.pl line 1, near "pl"
BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted at /home/damaged/public_html/plugins/MTLJPost/MTLJPost.pl line 86.
Compilation failed in require at lib/MT.pm line 551.


So what am I doing wrong? Are there any other files that I need to install.

Thanks,
Elena

**[alex](#5 "2007-06-14 19:56:33"):** Hey there. I know you're not actively supporting MTLJPost anymore, but I was wondering if I could get the documentation anywhere? Documentation links to https://www.kodekoan.com/projects/mtplugins/MTLJPost/ give me a "forbidden" and there's just the one plugin file in the download. Thanks, I appreciate it.
