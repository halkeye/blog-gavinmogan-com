# About Me

I'm Gavin.

I'm a tinker, maker, and software developer.

At home I code, game, hang out, all the cool non robot things to do.

I was heavily involved with Jenkins OSS project, including being on the board for a number of years. Lately I'm playing around with k8s and godot.

You can find my random projects at [https://apps.gavinmogan.com](https://apps.gavinmogan.com)

I also play games, both board and video games and love to read.\nYou can usually find me on various services as halkeye.
